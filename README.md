## Moduli of tropical plane curves

We study the moduli space of metric graphs that arise from tropical plane curves. There
are far fewer such graphs than tropicalizations of classical plane curves. For fixed genus
g, our moduli space is a stacky fan whose cones are indexed by regular unimodular
triangulations of Newton polygons with g interior lattice points. It has dimension
2g + 1 unless g ≤ 3 or g = 7. We compute these spaces explicitly for g ≤ 5.

## Forbidden patterns in tropical plane curves

Tropical curves in $R^2$ correspond to metric planar graphs but not all planar graphs
arise in this way. We describe several new classes of graphs which cannot occur.
For instance, this yields a full combinatorial characterization of the tropically planar
graphs of genus at most five.

## Generalised cone complexes and tropical moduli in polymake

We investigate geometric embeddings among several classes of generalised cone complexes and algorithms, e.g., to compute their homology.
Interesting cases arise from moduli spaces of tropical curves.
Specifically, we study the embedding of the moduli of tropical honeycomb curves into the moduli of all tropical $K_4$-curves.
